			<h2>Information:</h2>
			<p>For me, entering the Game Development world was very difficult when I was younger, as I didn't know where to start, or which path to take. I think a large part of that was simply not knowing enough about how to begin. For this reason, I began documenting the different methods to create video games for different systems. One such example was a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p6EM3h34s7B2LSoq1twFvjw-8X--FBGwBYeg4m9_5WM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a> containing information about which tools to use to compile or run different programming languages on different gaming systems and consoles I used growing up.</p>
			<p>Although such information was useful, I knew this wasn't all there was, and I also knew that these means to demonstrate the information were limited. This, I set out to create a tool that improves upon this current information, makes it more accessible, and makes it easy to get started. The obvious answer was to create a web site. This has brought me to where I am today.</p>
