			<p>For me, entering the Game Development world was very difficult when I was younger, as I didn't know where to start, or which path to take. I think a large part of that was simply not knowing enough about how to begin. For this reason, I began documenting the different methods to create video games for different systems. One such example was a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p6EM3h34s7B2LSoq1twFvjw-8X--FBGwBYeg4m9_5WM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a> containing information about which tools to use to compile or run different programming languages on different gaming systems and consoles I used growing up.</p>
			<p>Although such information was useful, I knew this wasn't all there was, and I also knew that these means to demonstrate the information were limited. This, I set out to create a tool that improves upon this current information, makes it more accessible, and makes it easy to get started. The obvious answer was to create a web site. This has brought me to where I am today.</p>
			<p>My research shows that nearly every publicly available modern game engine that can be reasonably found through internet searches is documented here, but note that due to the sheer number of graphics libraries and runtimes in existence, the results returned for graphics libraries are limited. There will be more additions in the future.</p>
