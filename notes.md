## Game engine:
- does not rely on any external compilers or interpreters
- Some libraries or frameworks might call themselves engines, but aren't, at least in the way we mean. 

## gfx-libs:
- relies upon compilers (could be general or specific) unless for interpreted language

## compiler:
- must know source languages and target platforms
- can also inlude specialized interpreters (like microlua for nds)??
