# Gamedev Springboard

## Purpose

The purpose of this tool is to help budding game developers find good places to start with their coding projects. It will allow them to filter game development toolkits, libraries, fantasy consoles, and engines all by programming language, source operating system, target platform, price, ease of use, and functionality.

## Target Audience

The target users of this site are mainly video game developers, but it also should be useful to any other kind of software developer!

## Limitations

I understand that it is virtually impossible to collect all information about every game engine or graphics library in existence, so this website should never be seen as a comprehensive list. However, this tool will still give any programmer a great idea of where to start.
