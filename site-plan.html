			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The purpose of this site is to help budding game developers find good places to start with their coding projects. It will allow them to filter game development toolkits, libraries, fantasy consoles, and engines all by programming language, source operating system, target platform, price, ease of use, and functionality. </p>


			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>The target users of this site are mainly video game developers, but it also should be useful to any other kind of software developer!</p>	<!-- change this -->

			<h2>Branding</h2>
			<h3>Website Logo</h3>
			<!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.	A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.	You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.	-->

			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<p>For me, entering the Game Development world was very difficult when I was younger, as I didn't know where to start, or which path to take. I think a large part of that was simply not knowing enough about how to begin. For this reason, I began documenting the different methods to create video games for different systems. One such example was a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p6EM3h34s7B2LSoq1twFvjw-8X--FBGwBYeg4m9_5WM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a> containing information about which tools to use to compile or run different programming languages on different gaming systems and consoles I used growing up.</p>
			<p>Although such information was useful, I knew this wasn't all there was, and I also knew that these means to demonstrate the information were limited. This, I set out to create a tool that improves upon this current information, makes it more accessible, and makes it easy to get started. The obvious answer was to create a web site. This has brought me to where I am today.</p>

			<h3>Game Engines</h3>
			<p>
				See test page <a href="engines" target="_blank">here</a>! This page dynamically renders its content based on the information contained in <a href="data/engines.json">a .json file</a>, so static images don't really apply as well to the page.

			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>
				I am Preston Corless. I like to code üë®‚Äçüíª, do gymnastics ü§∏, and play the guitar üé∏! But not all at the same time! üòâ</p>
				<p>I am an Eagle Scout, a former competitive gymnast, and a lifelong member of the <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org" target="_blank">Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints</a>. I graduated from the <a href="https://www.iamacomb.org/" target="_blank">International Academy of Macomb</a> in 2020 and then served a two-year mission for my church in üá∏üáª El Salvador, and I am currently attending <a href="https://www.byui.edu/" target="_blank">BYU-Idaho</a>, majoring in Software Engineering.</p>
				<p>I have had an interest in programming since I was about 12, when I began to learn how to create games for the NES in 6502 assembly. I finally finished my first game about 3 years later, and then moved on to other languages. Since then, I have developed a love of coding. I have learned HTML5 + JavaScript and Python since then, and spent a lot of time experimenting in other languages, too!</p>
				<p>I am from Detroit, Michigan, currently residing in Rexburg, Idaho. I have recently been involved in some of BYU-Idaho's software-related events and organizations, including taking first place in its Fall 2022 Hackathon.
